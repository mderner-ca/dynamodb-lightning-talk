# What?

DynamoDB is a noSQL database provided by AWS. It is the **_only_** forever free database solution provided by AWS (at time of writing 2025-03-17), everything else has a free trial just long enough that it's too difficult to migrate off of right before you're hit with massive costs. Anecdotally, I had a friend doing some AWS learning and she switched on RDS (the main AWS SQL solution) for a little bit, no real data, no real queries, and it cost her Â£30 that month.

DynamoDB is free as long as you:
- store less than 20Gb of data (more complex to count than first thought)
- provision for 25 or less Read Capacity Units (RCUs) and Write Capacity Units (WCUs)

# Terms

A source of data is called a **table** much as it is in other database services, a table contains many **items** (not records), and an item consists of one of more **attributes** (not fields). The initial table you create is known as the "base table".
